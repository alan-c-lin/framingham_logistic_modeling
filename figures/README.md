# Figures

This folder contains exported plots from the Framingham Logistic Modeling project:

- `figure1_accuracy_comparison_methods.pdf` — Bar chart comparing the accuracy of the classification methods.  
- `figure2_confusion_matrix_methods.pdf` — Confusion matrix heatmap for all classification methods.

Figures are included for reference; all plots are also embedded in the R Markdown outputs (`.Rmd`, `.html`, and `.pdf`).
